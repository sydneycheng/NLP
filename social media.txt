Great job! Great game! Keep it going!
Great game Baylor. Way to come back. I think Jaden needs to look for her shot a little more. We need offense off the bench. We got to find away to get Asberry going. Overall baylor put up a good fight. Progress looking good !!
Much better outcome than I expected.
Tough game but the Bears really upped their game from the first 3 games. They are clearly making progress. Keep working!
Bro you gotta play more than seven people if you want to win they ARE college athletes for a reason.
You guys did good.
TRASH hahaha.
Good game!!!!!!!! Sic’em 
So proud of you Baylor! You fought until the end!
Great effort!
Jaden needs to take more shots from mid range. When it’s clear that Jaymee isn’t having a good game in the first quarter y’all need to put in Owens for her earlier so she can get in a groove. Stop waiting till second half to make that change.
Proud proud proud. Big things in store for this team. Wish I could have watched the game!
Great Game
